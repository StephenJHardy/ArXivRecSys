    "abstract": "Deep generative replay has emerged as a promising approach for continual\nlearning in decision-making tasks. This approach addresses the problem of\ncatastrophic forgetting by leveraging the generation of trajectories from\npreviously encountered tasks to augment the current dataset. However, existing\ndeep generative replay methods for continual learning rely on autoregressive\nmodels, which suffer from compounding errors in the generated trajectories. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple, scalable, and non-autoregressive method for\ncontinual learning in decision-making tasks using a generative model that\ngenerates task samples conditioned on the trajectory timestep. We evaluate our\nmethod on Continual World benchmarks and find that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the average success rate metric among continual\nlearning methods.

Despite LLMs' successes in other domains, it is\nchallenging to develop LLM-based products for social networks for numerous\nreasons, and it has been relatively under-reported in the research community.\nWe categorize LLM applications for social networks into three categories. First\nis knowledge tasks where users want to find new knowledge and information, such\nas search and question-answering. Second is entertainment tasks where users\nwant to consume interesting content, such as getting entertaining notification\ncontent. Third is foundational tasks that need to be done to moderate and\noperate the social networks, such as content annotation and LLM monitoring.

For both\nfinite-dimensional and ODE systems, moving-horizon estimators (MHE) are\noperators whose output is the state estimate, while their inputs are the\ninitial state estimate at the beginning of the horizon as well as the measured\noutput and input signals over the moving time horizon. In this paper we\nintroduce MHEs for PDEs which remove the need for a numerical solution of an\nobserver PDE in real time. We accomplish this using the PDE backstepping method\nwhich, for certain classes of both hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, produces\nmoving-horizon state estimates explicitly. Precisely, to explicitly produce the\nstate estimates, we employ a backstepping transformation of a hard-to-solve\nobserver PDE into a target observer PDE, which is explicitly solvable. The MHEs\nwe propose are not new observer designs but simply the explicit MHE\nrealizations, over a moving horizon of arbitrary length, of the existing\nbackstepping observers. Our PDE MHEs lack the optimality of the MHEs that arose\nas duals of MPC, but they are given explicitly, even for PDEs.

The GS version of PDE backstepping employs gains\nobtained by solving a PDE at each value of the state. Performing such PDE\ncomputations in real time may be prohibitive.

In this paper we\nintroduce NOs for GS-PDE backstepping. GS controllers act on the premise that\nthe state change is slow and, as a result, guarantee only local stability, even\nfor ODEs. We establish local stabilization of hyperbolic PDEs with nonlinear\nrecirculation using both a \"full-kernel\" approach and the \"gain-only\" approach\nto gain operator approximation. Numerical simulations illustrate stabilization\nand demonstrate speedup by three orders of magnitude over traditional PDE\ngain-scheduling.

However,\nthe widely observed modality gap in the latent space of CLIP harms the\nperformance of zero-shot captioning by breaking the alignment between paired\nimage-text features. To address this issue, we conduct an analysis on the CLIP\nlatent space which leads to two findings. Firstly, we observe that the CLIP's\nvisual feature of image subregions can achieve closer proximity to the paired\ncaption due to the inherent information loss in text descriptions. In addition,\nwe show that the modality gap between a paired image-text can be empirically\nmodeled as a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Motivated by the findings, we\npropose a novel zero-shot image captioning framework with text-only training to\nreduce the modality gap. In particular, we introduce a subregion feature\naggregation to leverage local region information, which produces a compact\nvisual representation for matching text representation.

When implementing bidirectional local interactions, the local\ncontents of images tend to be cluttered or unrelated to their textual\ndescriptions. Thus, we employ an attentive masking strategy to select effective\nimage patches for interaction.

    "abstract": "Evaluating the quality and variability of text generated by Large Language\nModels (LLMs) poses a significant, yet unresolved research challenge.\nTraditional evaluation methods, such as ROUGE and BERTScore, which measure\ntoken similarity, often fail to capture the holistic semantic equivalence. This\nresults in a low correlation with human judgments and intuition, which is\nespecially problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance\nwhere reliability, safety, and robust decision-making are highly critical. This\nwork proposes DCR, an automated framework for evaluating and improving the\nconsistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach.\nUnlike existing LLM-based evaluators that operate at the paragraph level, our\nmethod employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator (DCE) that breaks down the\nparagraph-to-paragraph comparison between two generated responses into\nindividual sentence-to-paragraph comparisons, each evaluated based on\npredefined criteria. To facilitate this approach, we introduce an automatic\nmetric converter (AMC) that translates the output from DCE into an\ninterpretable numeric score. Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further\npresent a reason-assisted improver (RAI) that leverages the analytical reasons\nwith explanations identified by DCE to generate new responses aimed at reducing\nthese inconsistencies. Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis,\nwe show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large\nmargin (e.g., +19.3% and +24.3% on the SummEval dataset) in evaluating the\nconsistency of LLM generation across multiple benchmarks in semantic, factual,\nand summarization consistency tasks. Our approach also substantially reduces\nnearly 90% of output inconsistencies, showing promise for effective\nhallucination mitigation.",

That is why ACPs are being investigated as potential candidates for\ncancer therapy. ACPs may be used alone or in combination with other treatment\nmodalities like chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

However,\nrecent research indicates without external feedback, LLM's intrinsic reflection\nis unstable. Our investigation unveils that the key bottleneck is the quality\nof the self-evaluated feedback. We find LLMs often exhibit overconfidence or\nhigh randomness when self-evaluate, offering stubborn or inconsistent feedback,\nwhich causes poor reflection. To remedy this, we advocate Self-Contrast: It\nadaptively explores diverse solving perspectives tailored to the request,\ncontrasts the differences, and summarizes these discrepancies into a checklist\nwhich could be used to re-examine and eliminate discrepancies. Our method\nendows LLM with diverse perspectives to alleviate stubborn biases. Moreover,\ntheir discrepancies indicate potential errors or inherent uncertainties that\nLLM often overlooks. Reflecting upon these can catalyze more accurate and\nstable reflection. Experiments conducted on a series of reasoning and\ntranslation tasks with different LLMs serve to underscore the effectiveness and\ngenerality of our strategy.",

    "abstract": "Hardware generators help designers explore families of concrete designs and\ntheir efficiency trade-offs. Both parameterized hardware description languages\n(HDLs) and higher-level programming models, however, can obstruct\ncomposability. Different concrete designs in a family can have dramatically\ndifferent timing behavior, and high-level hardware generators rarely expose a\nconsistent HDL-level interface. Composition, therefore, is typically only\nfeasible at the level of individual instances: the user generates concrete\ndesigns and then composes them, sacrificing the ability to parameterize the\ncombined design.\n  We design Parafil, a system for correctly composing hardware generators.\nParafil builds on Filament, an HDL with strong compile-time guarantees, and\nlifts those guarantees to generators to prove that all possible instantiations\nare free of timing bugs. Parafil can integrate with external hardware\ngenerators via a novel system of output parameters and a framework for invoking\ngenerator tools. We conduct experiments with two other generators, FloPoCo and\nGoogle's XLS, and we implement a parameterized FFT generator to show that\nParafil ensures correct design space exploration.",

    "abstract": "Modern RISC-V platforms control and monitor security-critical systems such as\nindustrial controllers and autonomous vehicles. While these platforms feature a\nRoot-of-Trust (RoT) to store authentication secrets and enable secure boot\ntechnologies, they often lack Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) enforcement and are\nvulnerable to cyber-attacks which divert the control flow of an application to\ntrigger malicious behaviours. Recent techniques to enforce CFI in RISC-V\nsystems include ISA modifications or custom hardware IPs, all requiring ad-hoc\nbinary toolchains or design of CFI primitives in hardware. This paper proposes\nTitanCFI, a novel approach to enforce CFI in the RoT. TitanCFI modifies the\ncommit stage of the protected core to stream control flow instructions to the\nRoT and it integrates the CFI enforcement policy in the RoT firmware. Our\napproach enables maximum reuse of the hardware resource present in the\nSystem-on-Chip (SoC), and it avoids the design of custom IPs and the\nmodification of the compilation toolchain, while exploiting the RoT\ntamper-proof storage and cryptographic accelerators to secure CFI metadata. We\nimplemented the proposed architecture on a modern RISC-V SoC along with a\nreturn address protection policy in the RoT, and benchmarked area and runtime\noverhead. Experimental results show that TitanCFI achieves overhead comparable\nto SoA hardware CFI solutions for most benchmarks, with lower area overhead,\nresulting in 1% of additional area occupation.",

    "abstract": "The globalization of the Integrated Circuit (IC) supply chain, driven by\ntime-to-market and cost considerations, has made ICs vulnerable to hardware\nTrojans (HTs). Against this threat, a promising approach is to use Machine\nLearning (ML)-based side-channel analysis, which has the advantage of being a\nnon-intrusive method, along with efficiently detecting HTs under golden\nchip-free settings. In this paper, we question the trustworthiness of ML-based\nHT detection via side-channel analysis. We introduce a HT obfuscation (HTO)\napproach to allow HTs to bypass this detection method. Rather than\ntheoretically misleading the model by simulated adversarial traces, a key\naspect of our approach is the design and implementation of adversarial noise as\npart of the circuitry, alongside the HT. We detail HTO methodologies for ASICs\nand FPGAs, and evaluate our approach using TrustHub benchmark. Interestingly,\nwe found that HTO can be implemented with only a single transistor for ASIC\ndesigns to generate adversarial power traces that can fool the defense with\n100% efficiency. We also efficiently implemented our approach on a Spartan 6\nXilinx FPGA using 2 different variants: (i) DSP slices-based, and (ii)\nring-oscillator-based design. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of\ncountermeasures like spectral domain analysis, and we show that an adaptive\nattacker can still design evasive HTOs by constraining the design with a\nspectral noise budget. In addition, while adversarial training (AT) offers\nhigher protection against evasive HTs, AT models suffer from a considerable\nutility loss, potentially rendering them unsuitable for such security\napplication.

    "abstract": "Despite the fundamental role the Quantum Satisfiability (QSAT) problem has\nplayed in quantum complexity theory, a central question remains open: At which\nlocal dimension does the complexity of QSAT transition from \"easy\" to \"hard\"?\nHere, we study QSAT with each constraint acting on a $k$-dimensional and\n$l$-dimensional qudit pair, denoted $(k,l)$-QSAT. Our first main result shows\nthat, surprisingly, QSAT on qubits can remain $\\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hard, in that\n$(2,5)$-QSAT is $\\mathsf{QMA}_1$-complete. In contrast, $2$-SAT on qubits is\nwell-known to be poly-time solvable [Bravyi, 2006]. Our second main result\nproves that $(3,d)$-QSAT on the 1D line with $d\\in O(1)$ is also\n$\\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hard. Finally, we initiate the study of 1D $(2,d)$-QSAT by\ngiving a frustration-free 1D Hamiltonian with a unique, entangled ground state.\n  Our first result uses a direct embedding, combining a novel clock\nconstruction with the 2D circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction of [Gosset, Nagaj,\n2013]. Of note is a new simplified and analytic proof for the latter (as\nopposed to a partially numeric proof in [GN13]). This exploits Unitary Labelled\nGraphs [Bausch, Cubitt, Ozols, 2017] together with a new \"Nullspace Connection\nLemma\", allowing us to break low energy analyses into small patches of\nprojectors, and to improve the soundness analysis of [GN13] from\n$\\Omega(1/T^6)$ to $\\Omega(1/T^2)$, for $T$ the number of gates. Our second\nresult goes via black-box reduction: Given an arbitrary 1D Hamiltonian $H$ on\n$d'$-dimensional qudits, we show how to embed it into an effective null-space\nof a 1D $(3,d)$-QSAT instance, for $d\\in O(1)$. Our approach may be viewed as a\nweaker notion of \"simulation\" (\\`a la [Bravyi, Hastings 2017], [Cubitt,\nMontanaro, Piddock 2018]). As far as we are aware, this gives the first\n\"black-box simulation\"-based $\\mathsf{QMA}_1$-hardness result, i.e. for\nfrustration-free Hamiltonians.",

    "title": "Location Aware Modular Biencoder for Tourism Question Answering",
    "abstract": "Answering real-world tourism questions that seek Point-of-Interest (POI)\nrecommendations is challenging, as it requires both spatial and non-spatial\nreasoning, over a large candidate pool. The traditional method of encoding each\npair of question and POI becomes inefficient when the number of candidates\nincreases, making it infeasible for real-world applications. To overcome this,\nwe propose treating the QA task as a dense vector retrieval problem, where we\nencode questions and POIs separately and retrieve the most relevant POIs for a\nquestion by utilizing embedding space similarity. We use pretrained language\nmodels (PLMs) to encode textual information, and train a location encoder to\ncapture spatial information of POIs. Experiments on a real-world tourism QA\ndataset demonstrate that our approach is effective, efficient, and outperforms\nprevious methods across all metrics. Enabled by the dense retrieval\narchitecture, we further build a global evaluation baseline, expanding the\nsearch space by 20 times compared to previous work. We also explore several\nfactors that impact on the model's performance through follow-up experiments.\nOur code and model are publicly available at https://github.com/haonan-li/LAMB.",

However, access to model updates (e.g.\ngradient updates in deep neural networks) transferred between clients and\nservers can reveal sensitive information to adversaries. Differential privacy\n(DP) offers a framework that gives a privacy guarantee by adding certain\namounts of noise to parameters. This approach, although being effective in\nterms of privacy, adversely affects model performance due to noise involvement.\nHence, it is always needed to find a balance between noise injection and the\nsacrificed accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose adaptive noise\naddition in FL which decides the value of injected noise based on features'\nrelative importance. Here, we first propose two effective methods for\nprioritizing features in deep neural network models and then perturb models'\nweights based on this information. Specifically, we try to figure out whether\nthe idea of adding more noise to less important parameters and less noise to\nmore important parameters can effectively save the model accuracy while\npreserving privacy.

    "title": "Learning to Prompt with Text Only Supervision for Vision-Language Models",
    "abstract": "Foundational vision-language models such as CLIP are becoming a new paradigm\nin vision, due to their excellent generalization abilities. However, adapting\nthese models for downstream tasks while maintaining their generalization\nremains a challenge. In literature, one branch of methods adapts CLIP by\nlearning prompts using visual information. While effective, most of these works\nrequire labeled data which is not practical, and often struggle to generalize\ntowards new datasets due to over-fitting on the source data. An alternative\napproach resorts to training-free methods by generating class descriptions from\nlarge language models (LLMs) and perform prompt ensembling. However, these\nmethods often generate class specific prompts that cannot be transferred to\nother classes, which incur higher costs by generating LLM descriptions for each\nclass separately. In this work, we propose to combine the strengths of these\nboth streams of methods by learning prompts using only text data derived from\nLLMs. As supervised training of prompts is not trivial due to absence of\nimages, we develop a training approach that allows prompts to extract rich\ncontextual knowledge from LLM data. Moreover, with LLM contextual data mapped\nwithin the learned prompts, it enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to new\nclasses and datasets potentially cutting the LLM prompt engineering cost. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work that learns generalized\nprompts using text only data. We perform extensive evaluations on 4 benchmarks\nwhere our method improves over prior ensembling works while being competitive\nto those utilizing labeled images.

In particular, overfishing is\none the main issues in sustainable marine development. In alignment with the\nprotection of marine resources and sustainable fishing, this study proposes to\nadvance fish classification techniques that support identifying protected fish\nspecies using state-of-the-art machine learning. We use a custom modification\nof the MobileNet model to design a lightweight classifier called M-MobileNet\nthat is capable of running on limited hardware. As part of the study, we\ncompiled a labeled dataset of 37,462 images of fish found in the waters of the\nIndonesian archipelago. The proposed model is trained on the dataset to\nclassify images of the captured fish into their species and give\nrecommendations on whether they are consumable or not. Our modified MobileNet\nmodel uses only 50\\% of the top layer parameters with about 42% GTX 860M\nutility and achieves up to 97% accuracy in fish classification and determining\nits consumability. Given the limited computing capacity available on many\nfishing vessels, the proposed model provides a practical solution to on-site\nfish classification. In addition, synchronized implementation of the proposed\nmodel on multiple vessels can supply valuable information about the movement\nand location of different species of fish.",

The\nproblem is easily fixed by initializing inference with samples from an\napproximation of noisy images. However, in using such an approximation, the\njoint distribution of text and noisy image at inference time still slightly\ndiffers from that at training time. This discrepancy is corrected by training\nthe network with samples from the approximate noisy image distribution.\nExtensive experiments on real application data show significant qualitative and\nquantitative improvements in performance from adopting these procedures.\nFinally, our procedure can interact well with other control-based methods to\nfurther enhance the controllability of diffusion-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Existing federated learning methods have effectively dealt with decentralized\nlearning in scenarios involving data privacy and non-IID data. However, in\nreal-world situations, each client dynamically learns new classes, requiring\nthe global model to classify all seen classes. To effectively mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting and data heterogeneity under low communication costs,\nwe propose a simple and effective method named PILoRA. On the one hand, we\nadopt prototype learning to learn better feature representations and leverage\nthe heuristic information between prototypes and class features to design a\nprototype re-weight module to solve the classifier bias caused by data\nheterogeneity without retraining the classifier. On the other hand, we view\nincremental learning as the process of learning distinct task vectors and\nencoding them within different LoRA parameters. Accordingly, we propose\nIncremental LoRA to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on\nstandard datasets indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\napproaches significantly. More importantly, our method exhibits strong\nrobustness and superiority in different settings and degrees of data\nheterogeneity.

Current ReID methods assume that the deployed system follows the\ncentralized processing paradigm, i.e., all computations are conducted in the\ncloud server and edge devices are only used to capture images. As the number of\nvideos experiences a rapid escalation, this paradigm has become impractical due\nto the finite computational resources in the cloud server. Therefore, the ReID\nsystem should be converted to fit in the cloud-edge collaborative processing\nparadigm, which is crucial to boost its scalability and practicality. However,\ncurrent works lack relevant research on this important specific issue, making\nit difficult to adapt them into a cloud-edge framework effectively. In this\npaper, we propose a cloud-edge collaborative inference framework for ReID\nsystems, aiming to expedite the return of the desired image captured by the\ncamera to the cloud server by learning the spatial-temporal correlations among\nobjects. In the system, a Distribution-aware Correlation Modeling network\n(DaCM) is particularly proposed to embed the spatial-temporal correlations of\nthe camera network implicitly into a graph structure, and it can be applied 1)\nin the cloud to regulate the size of the upload window and 2) on the edge\ndevice to adjust the sequence of images, respectively.

As ML-driven\ndecisions proliferate, particularly in cases involving sensitive attributes\nsuch as gender, race, and age, to name a few, the need for equity and\nimpartiality has emerged as a fundamental concern. In situations demanding\nreal-time decision-making, fairness objectives become more nuanced and complex:\ninstantaneous fairness to ensure equity in every time slot, and long-term\nfairness to ensure fairness over a period of time.

Our\nexperiments on a 24-core server show that our algorithms obtain good parallel\nspeedups, and are significantly faster than equivalent algorithms in existing\ntemporal graph processing systems: up to 60x against a shared-memory approach,\nand several orders of magnitude when compared with distributed processing of\ngraphs that fit within a single server.",

    "title": "Starling: An I/O-Efficient Disk-Resident Graph Index Framework for High-Dimensional Vector Similarity Search on Data Segment",
    "abstract": "High-dimensional vector similarity search (HVSS) is gaining prominence as a\npowerful tool for various data science and AI applications. As vector data\nscales up, in-memory indexes pose a significant challenge due to the\nsubstantial increase in main memory requirements. A potential solution involves\nleveraging disk-based implementation, which stores and searches vector data on\nhigh-performance devices like NVMe SSDs. However, implementing HVSS for data\nsegments proves to be intricate in vector databases where a single machine\ncomprises multiple segments for system scalability. In this context, each\nsegment operates with limited memory and disk space, necessitating a delicate\nbalance between accuracy, efficiency, and space cost. Existing disk-based\nmethods fall short as they do not holistically address all these requirements\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we present Starling, an I/O-efficient\ndisk-resident graph index framework that optimizes data layout and search\nstrategy within the segment. It has two primary components: (1) a data layout\nincorporating an in-memory navigation graph and a reordered disk-based graph\nwith enhanced locality, reducing the search path length and minimizing disk\nbandwidth wastage; and (2) a block search strategy designed to minimize costly\ndisk I/O operations during vector query execution. Through extensive\nexperiments, we validate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of\nStarling. On a data segment with 2GB memory and 10GB disk capacity, Starling\ncan accommodate up to 33 million vectors in 128 dimensions, offering HVSS with\nover 0.9 average precision and top-10 recall rate, and latency under 1\nmillisecond. The results showcase Starling's superior performance, exhibiting\n43.9$\\times$ higher throughput with 98% lower query latency compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods while maintaining the same level of accuracy.",

In a computer-based\nmodular plant scenario, participants chose between process parameter\nmodifications (Adapt) and reconfigurations of the module setup (Exchange).\nSolution costs were presented either as graphs depicting parameter relations,\nseparate numbers for each parameter, or integrated numbers for each solution.\nIt was hypothesised that graphs induce satisficing (i.e., basing decisions only\non Adapt), whereas the numeric formats foster a comparison of the solutions\n(i.e., basing decisions on the Adapt/Exchange ratio). The hypothesised effects\nwere restricted to situations with medium Adapt costs. A second experiment\nreplicated these findings while adjusting the scale of numeric formats. We\nconclude that Adapt/Exchange decisions are shaped by an interaction of\nstructural and surface features.",

Unlike traditional similar relationships, items with complementary\nrelationships may be purchased successively (such as iPhone and Airpods Pro),\nand they not only share relevance but also exhibit dissimilarity. Since the two\nattributes are opposites, modeling complementary relationships is challenging.\nPrevious attempts to exploit these relationships have either ignored or\noversimplified the dissimilarity attribute, resulting in ineffective modeling\nand an inability to balance the two attributes. Since Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) can capture the relevance and dissimilarity between nodes in the\nspectral domain, we can leverage spectral-based GNNs to effectively understand\nand model complementary relationships.

However, this approach faces difficulties when the dynamic test\ndistribution is available only in small batches and without access to the\noriginal source data. To address the challenge of adapting to dynamic\ndistributions in such practical settings, we propose Continual Multi-source\nAdaptation to Dynamic Distributions (CONTRAST), a novel method that optimally\ncombines multiple source models to adapt to the dynamic test data. CONTRAST has\ntwo distinguishing features.

Second, it identifies which of\nthe source model parameters to update so that only the model which is most\ncorrelated to the target data is adapted, leaving the less correlated ones\nuntouched; this mitigates the issue of ``forgetting\" the source model\nparameters by focusing only on the source model that exhibits the strongest\ncorrelation with the test batch distribution. Through theoretical analysis we\nshow that the proposed method is able to optimally combine the source models\nand prioritize updates to the model least prone to forgetting. Experimental\nanalysis on diverse datasets demonstrates that the combination of multiple\nsource models does at least as well as the best source (with hindsight\nknowledge), and performance does not degrade as the test data distribution\nchanges over time (robust to forgetting).",

This paper\npresents a comprehensive framework for hyperparameter estimation in SBL models,\nencompassing well-known algorithms such as the expectation-maximization (EM),\nMacKay, and convex bounding (CB) algorithms. These algorithms are cohesively\ninterpreted within an alternating minimization and linearization (AML)\nparadigm, distinguished by their unique linearized surrogate functions.\nAdditionally, a novel algorithm within the AML framework is introduced, showing\nenhanced efficiency, especially under low signal noise ratios. This is further\nimproved by a new alternating minimization and quadratic approximation (AMQ)\nparadigm, which includes a proximal regularization term. The paper\nsubstantiates these advancements with thorough convergence analysis and\nnumerical experiments, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in various\nnoise conditions and signal-to-noise ratios.",

This paper considers a general framework\nof noisy low-rank-plus-sparse matrix recovery, where the noise matrix may come\nfrom any joint distribution with arbitrary dependence across entries.

To attain this, we establish a novel\nresult asserting that the difference between two arbitrary low-rank incoherent\nmatrices must spread energy out across its entries, in other words cannot be\ntoo sparse, which sheds light on the structure of incoherent low-rank matrices\nand may be of independent interest. We then showcase the applications of our\nframework to several important statistical machine learning problems.

In this paper, we propose a\ndifferent approach to generating synthetic functional training data that does\nnot require solving a PDE numerically. We draw a large number $N$ of\nindependent and identically distributed 'random functions' $u_j$ from the\nunderlying solution space (e.g., $H_0^1(\\Omega)$) in which we know the solution\nlies according to classical theory. We then plug each such random candidate\nsolution into the equation and get a corresponding right-hand side function\n$f_j$ for the equation, and consider $(f_j, u_j)_{j=1}^N$ as supervised\ntraining data for learning the underlying inverse problem $f \\rightarrow u$.\nThis `backwards' approach to generating training data only requires derivative\ncomputations, in contrast to standard `forward' approaches, which require a\nnumerical PDE solver, enabling us to generate many data points quickly and\nefficiently.

In this work, we present the Energy-Based Diffusion Generator\n(EDG), a novel approach that integrates ideas from variational autoencoders and\ndiffusion models. EDG leverages a decoder to transform latent variables from a\nsimple distribution into samples approximating the target Boltzmann\ndistribution, while the diffusion-based encoder provides an accurate estimate\nof the Kullback-Leibler divergence during training. Notably, EDG is\nsimulation-free, eliminating the need to solve ordinary or stochastic\ndifferential equations during training. Furthermore, by removing constraints\nsuch as bijectivity in the decoder, EDG allows for flexible network design.\nThrough empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the superior performance of EDG\nacross a variety of complex distribution tasks, outperforming existing methods.",

    "abstract": "With growing concerns regarding bias and discrimination in predictive models,\nthe AI community has increasingly focused on assessing AI system\ntrustworthiness. Conventionally, trustworthy AI literature relies on the\nprobabilistic framework and calibration as prerequisites for trustworthiness.\nIn this work, we depart from this viewpoint by proposing a novel trust\nframework inspired by the philosophy literature on trust. We present a precise\nmathematical definition of trustworthiness, termed\n$\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness, specifically tailored for a subset of tasks\naimed at maximizing a utility function. We argue that a model's\n$\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness is contingent upon its ability to maximize Bayes\nutility within this task subset. Our first set of results challenges the\nprobabilistic framework by demonstrating its potential to favor less\ntrustworthy models and introduce the risk of misleading trustworthiness\nassessments. Within the context of $\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthiness, we prove that\nproperly-ranked models are inherently $\\mathcal{U}$-trustworthy. Furthermore,\nwe advocate for the adoption of the AUC metric as the preferred measure of\ntrustworthiness. By offering both theoretical guarantees and experimental\nvalidation, AUC enables robust evaluation of trustworthiness, thereby enhancing\nmodel selection and hyperparameter tuning to yield more trustworthy outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The current paradigm of training deep neural networks for classification\ntasks includes minimizing the empirical risk that pushes the training loss\nvalue towards zero, even after the training error has been vanished. In this\nterminal phase of training, it has been observed that the last-layer features\ncollapse to their class-means and these class-means converge to the vertices of\na simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). This phenomenon is termed as Neural\nCollapse (NC). To theoretically understand this phenomenon, recent works employ\na simplified unconstrained feature model to prove that NC emerges at the global\nsolutions of the training problem. However, when the training dataset is\nclass-imbalanced, some NC properties will no longer be true. For example, the\nclass-means geometry will skew away from the simplex ETF when the loss\nconverges. In this paper, we generalize NC to imbalanced regime for\ncross-entropy loss under the unconstrained ReLU feature model. We prove that,\nwhile the within-class features collapse property still holds in this setting,\nthe class-means will converge to a structure consisting of orthogonal vectors\nwith different lengths. Furthermore, we find that the classifier weights are\naligned to the scaled and centered class-means with scaling factors depend on\nthe number of training samples of each class, which generalizes NC in the\nclass-balanced setting.

Although widely used\nin constrained optimization, conventional saddle-point algorithms are not\ndirectly applicable here because of random packet dropping. To address this\nissue, we develop a robust decentralized saddle-point algorithm against random\nlink failures with heterogeneous probabilities by replacing the missing\ndecisions of neighbors with their latest received values.

Task scheduling is a critical issue in cloud computing,\nwhere an efficient task scheduling method can improve overall cloud\nperformance. Since cloud computing is a large-scale and geographically\ndistributed environment, traditional scheduling methods that allocate resources\nin a centralized manner are ineffective. Besides, traditional methods are\ndifficult to make rational decisions timely when the external environment\nchanges. This paper proposes a decentralized BDI (belief-desire-intention)\nagent-based scheduling framework for cloud computing. BDI agents have\nadvantages in modelling dynamic environments because BDI agents can update\ntheir beliefs, change desires, and trigger behaviours based on environmental\nchanges. Besides, to avoid communication stuck caused by environmental\nuncertainties, the asynchronous communication mode with a notify listener is\nemployed. The proposed framework covers both the task scheduling and\nrescheduling stages with the consideration of uncertain events that can\ninterrupt task executions. Two agent-based algorithms are proposed to implement\nthe task scheduling and rescheduling processes, and a novel recommendation\nmechanism is presented in the scheduling stage to reduce the impact of\ninformation synchronization delays. The proposed framework is implemented by\nJADEX and tested on CloudSim.

    "abstract": "One of the primary impediments hindering the widespread acceptance of\nautonomous vehicles (AVs) among pedestrians is their limited comprehension of\nAVs. This study employs virtual reality (VR) to provide pedestrians with an\nimmersive environment for engaging with and comprehending AVs during unmarked\nmidblock multilane crossings. Diverse AV driving behaviors were modeled to\nexhibit negotiation behavior with a yellow signal indication or non-yielding\nbehavior with a blue signal indication. This paper aims to investigate the\nimpact of various factors, such as AV behavior and signaling, pedestrian past\nbehavior, etc., on pedestrians' perception change of AVs. Before and after the\nVR experiment, participants completed surveys assessing their perception of\nAVs, focusing on two main aspects: \"Attitude\" and \"System Effectiveness.\" The\nWilcoxon signed-rank test results demonstrated that both pedestrians' overall\nattitude score toward AVs and trust in the effectiveness of AV systems\nsignificantly increased following the VR experiment. Notably, individuals who\nexhibited a greater trust in the yellow signals were more inclined to display a\nhigher attitude score toward AVs and to augment their trust in the\neffectiveness of AV systems. This indicates that the design of the yellow\nsignal instills pedestrians with greater confidence in their interactions with\nAVs. Further, pedestrians who exhibit more aggressive crossing behavior are\nless likely to change their perception towards AVs as compared to those\npedestrians with more positive crossing behaviors. It is concluded that\nintegrating this paper's devised AV behavior and signaling within an immersive\nVR setting facilitated pedestrian engagement with AVs, thereby changing their\nperception of AVs.",

Furthermore, we factorize the CTC output distribution\nand perform knowledge distillation on intermediate layers to reduce computation\nand improve recognition accuracy.

Prevailing methods, however,\nencounter limitations at adapting to new speakers of out-of-domain settings,\nprimarily due to inadequate speaker disentanglement and content leakage. To\novercome these constraints, we propose an innovative negation feature learning\nparadigm that models decoupled speaker attributes as deviations from the\ncomplete audio representation by utilizing the subtraction operation. By\neliminating superfluous content information from the speaker representation,\nour negation scheme not only mitigates content leakage, thereby enhancing\nsynthesis robustness, but also improves speaker fidelity. In addition, to\nfacilitate the learning of diverse speaker attributes, we leverage multi-stream\nTransformers, which retain multiple hypotheses and instigate a training\nparadigm akin to ensemble learning. To unify these hypotheses and realize the\nfinal speaker representation, we employ attention pooling. Finally, in light of\nthe imperative to generate target text utterances in the desired voice, we\nadopt adaptive layer normalizations to effectively fuse the previously\ngenerated speaker representation with the target text representations, as\nopposed to mere concatenation of the text and audio modalities.

While there are several\napproaches for testing and analysing them in high-fidelity simulators, ADSs may\nstill encounter additional critical scenarios beyond those covered once they\nare deployed on real roads. An additional level of confidence can be\nestablished by monitoring and enforcing critical properties when the ADS is\nrunning. Existing work, however, is only able to monitor simple safety\nproperties (e.g., avoidance of collisions) and is limited to blunt enforcement\nmechanisms such as hitting the emergency brakes. In this work, we propose\nREDriver, a general and modular approach to runtime enforcement, in which users\ncan specify a broad range of properties (e.g., national traffic laws) in a\nspecification language based on signal temporal logic (STL). REDriver monitors\nthe planned trajectory of the ADS based on a quantitative semantics of STL, and\nuses a gradient-driven algorithm to repair the trajectory when a violation of\nthe specification is likely.

Therefore, this\npaper systematically investigates the module conflict problem and its impact on\nthe Python ecosystem. We propose a novel technique called InstSimulator, which\nleverages semantics and installation simulation to achieve accurate and\nefficient module extraction. Based on this, we implement a tool called\nModuleGuard to detect module conflicts for the Python ecosystem. For the study,\nwe first collect 97 MC issues, classify the characteristics and causes of these\nMC issues, summarize three different conflict patterns, and analyze their\npotential threats. Then, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the whole PyPI\necosystem (4.2 million packages) and GitHub popular projects (3,711 projects)\nto detect each MC pattern and analyze their potential impact. We discovered\nthat module conflicts still impact numerous TPLs and GitHub projects.

To curb their spread, all efforts by institutions and policy makers\nrely mainly on imposing restriction, prohibition and fact checking sites, which\nend up to an effective limitation of freedom of speech. This policy of\nprohibition, supported by a wide consensus, has been recently broken by the\ncontroversial policy applied by Elon Musk to regulate the social media X, with\na backlash accusing him of promoting hate speech. Here, notwithstanding these\ntwo policies, I explore another avenue denoted ``No ban, No spread - with\nSequestration\", which amounts at the same time preserving full freedom of\nspeech and neutralization of fake news impact. To investigate the feasibility\nof my proposal, I tackle the issue within the Galam model of opinion dynamics.\nIn addition to the basic ingredients of the model, I explore for the first time\nthe effect on the dynamics of opinion of a simultaneous activation of prejudice\ntie breaking and contrarian behavior. The results show that indeed most pieces\nof fake news do not propagate beyond small groups of people and thus pose no\nglobal threat. However, I have unveiled some peculiar sets of parameters for\nwhich fake news, even if initially shared by only a handful of agents, spreads\n``naturally\" to invade a whole community with no resistance. Based on these\nfindings, I am able to outline a path to neutralize such invasive fake news by\nblocking \"naturally\" its spread, effectively sequestering it in very small\nsocial networks of people. The scheme relies on reshaping the social geometry\nof the landscape in which fake news evolves. No prohibition is required with\nfake news left free to prosper but being sequestrated. Next challenging step\nwill be designing measures to implement the model's findings into the real\nworld of social media.",

    "title": "Multivariate Functional Clustering with Variable Selection and Application to Sensor Data from Engineering Systems",
    "abstract": "Multi-sensor data that track system operating behaviors are widely available\nnowadays from various engineering systems. Measurements from each sensor over\ntime form a curve and can be viewed as functional data. Clustering of these\nmultivariate functional curves is important for studying the operating patterns\nof systems. One complication in such applications is the possible presence of\nsensors whose data do not contain relevant information. Hence it is desirable\nfor the clustering method to equip with an automatic sensor selection\nprocedure. Motivated by a real engineering application, we propose a functional\ndata clustering method that simultaneously removes noninformative sensors and\ngroups functional curves into clusters using informative sensors. Functional\nprincipal component analysis is used to transform multivariate functional data\ninto a coefficient matrix for data reduction. We then model the transformed\ndata by a Gaussian mixture distribution to perform model-based clustering with\nvariable selection. Three types of penalties, the individual, variable, and\ngroup penalties, are considered to achieve automatic variable selection.\nExtensive simulations are conducted to assess the clustering and variable\nselection performance of the proposed methods. The application of the proposed\nmethods to an engineering system with multiple sensors shows the promise of the\nmethods and reveals interesting patterns in the sensor data.",

    "abstract": "Quantiles are a fundamental concept in probability and theoretical statistics\nand a daily tool in their applications. While the univariate concept of\nquantiles is quite clear and well understood, its multivariate extension is\nmore problematic. After half a century of continued efforts and many proposals,\ntwo concepts, essentially, are emerging: the so-called (relabeled) geometric\nquantiles, extending the characterization of univariate quantiles as minimizers\nof an L1 loss function involving the check functions, and the more recent\ncenter-outward quantiles based on measure transportation ideas. These two\nconcepts yield distinct families of quantile regions and quantile contours. Our\nobjective here is to present a comparison of their main theoretical properties\nand a numerical investigation of their differences.",

    "title": "Singularity-agnostic incomplete U-statistics for testing polynomial constraints in Gaussian covariance matrices",
    "abstract": "Testing the goodness-of-fit of a model with its defining functional\nconstraints in the parameters could date back to Spearman (1927), who analyzed\nthe famous \"tetrad\" polynomial in the covariance matrix of the observed\nvariables in a single-factor model. Despite its long history, the Wald test\ntypically employed to operationalize this approach could produce very\ninaccurate test sizes in many situations, even when the regular conditions for\nthe classical normal asymptotics are met and a very large sample is available.\n  Focusing on testing a polynomial constraint in a Gaussian covariance matrix,\nwe obtained a new understanding of this baffling phenomenon: When the null\nhypothesis is true but \"near-singular\", the standardized Wald test exhibits\nslow weak convergence, owing to the sophisticated dependency structure inherent\nto the underlying U-statistic that ultimately drives its limiting distribution;\nthis can also be rigorously explained by a key ratio of moments encoded in the\nBerry-Esseen bound quantifying the normal approximation error involved. As an\nalternative, we advocate the use of an incomplete U-statistic to mildly tone\ndown the dependence thereof and render the speed of convergence agnostic to the\nsingularity status of the hypothesis. In parallel, we develop a Berry-Esseen\nbound that is mathematically descriptive of the singularity-agnostic nature of\nour standardized incomplete U-statistic, using some of the finest\nexponential-type inequalities in the literature.",
